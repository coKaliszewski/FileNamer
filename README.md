# FileNamer
Renames multiple files with extra features.

Especially useful for rename TV shows or files that require sequential formatting.

<h1>Usage</h1>
Enterting an astrik (*) anywhere in the Prefix field will replace it with a sequential number.  Example: The Simpsons - S01E* will be The Simpsons - S01E01, The Simpsons - S01E02, etc.  Custom number formatting, starting number, and increments are available.

Search and replace, and removing a specific number of characters from each file name is also possible.
